# My-Flight-Controller
Flight planning software

The objective of this project is to join all the stakeholders involved in simple civil aviation operations (ex: schools, general aviation) in a unique platform.

¿What i´ve seen?

When the pilots are starting their flight training, they face many problems related to communications: they do not know when they will be able to fly, what aircraft, with what instructors, they do not know exactly what maneuvers they are going to do, and they do not have a good return of the flights they already made.

The same happens with other actors: the instructors and the administrative staff.

Uncertainty becomes normal and greatly affects flight instruction.

It is essential to coordinate a large number of processes, to ensure the quality of aircraft maintenance and maintaining the level of instruction.

Nowadays, programming is done manually, and in some cases precarious computer systems are implemented, but there is a lot of information and potential outside.

Who we are?

I would like to form a team with professionals in the aeronautical industry and information systems.
 
My name is Hernán Martínez Reumann. I am a Naval Pilot Pilot and Aircraft Instructor, and I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Administration from the Naval University Institute of Argentina.

How to?

I thought about "My Controlled Flight".

An application that brings together all the actors of the aeronautical training process in a single platform.

Accessible from the PC, and from your cell phone or tablet.

All the flight information would be available in an integral way in the system:

Who is flying? (pilots and instructors)
On what plane?
When?
What kind of flight and what maneuvers are you going to do?
What will be the total approximate cost?

And very important, what was the result of the flight ?. Things that went well, and things that need to be improved.

A distinctive feature of this service is that each interested party will be the owner of their information, as a tool to demonstrate their experience, and can share it with their people of interest.

It is an operating system, accessible and developed to measure most of the aeronautical institutes.

Why?

In case of achieving the team, we will be able to carry out the stages of design and development of the platform.

Our launch date is between 2 and 3 years (2020). At the moment we will offer support, based on the continuous improvement of our processes.

We intend to reach all of America.

We are convinced that the aeronautical industry has a lot of growth potential, and those interested need to be always connected and in the same line. The current tools are already available and we only have to approach them to the users in the way that we know they need it.

Together we can create high impact tools for the first stages of learning of those who were interested in flying as a way of life.
